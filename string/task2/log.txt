The train station smelled faintly of rain and roasted peanuts, a place where stories paused between destinations.
A boy counted pigeons on the platform while an old man folded yesterday’s newspaper into a perfect square,
both waiting for something unnamed. Above them, the clock ticked like a patient heartbeat, reminding everyone 
that time moves even when we don’t. Somewhere, a whistle blew, and for a moment, the world felt like it was 
about to begin again.
